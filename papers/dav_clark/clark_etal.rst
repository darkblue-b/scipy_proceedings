.. class:: abstract

Virtual machines are widely used, but in an ad hoc manner. Members of the UC
Berkeley D-Lab, Statistical Computing Facility (SCF), and Berkeley Research
Computing (BRC) have evaluated a breadth of virtualization technologies and
present a strategy for constructing the Berkeley Common Environment [BCE]_. We
also provide a comparison with a successful, existing project, [OSGeo-Live]_.

.. class:: keywords

education, reproducibility, virtualization

Introduction ------------

Here we frame the problem space and describe the general class of devops
solutions.

Available Tools ---------------

"Collaboratool" was conceived as a project for building, integrating, and
deploying tools that support portable, reproducible data science.  We started
thinking about how to deploy virtualized containers that provide things like
IPython notebooks through the web. We were very inspired by
[jiffylab](http://github.com/ptone/jiffylab). From there, we decided that it
made more sense to focus on a complete virtual environment, which is easy to
deploy in a variety of contexts, which is what you'll find here now.

Lightweight virturalization (/ containerization) includes Docker / LXC / VMWare
ESX.

OSGeo-Live: A Successful Common Environment
-------------------------------------------

The OSGeo-Live, a project the Open Source Geospatial Foundation, is a vivid example 
of both a sophisticated compute environment, and synergistic community process;
quoting from the OSGeo-Live [1] website:

''' The OSGeo-Live is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual
Machine based on Xubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source
geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of
free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed
around.

It provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use cases,
including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data. It
also contains sample datasets and documentation. '''

After long years of "tepid" progress and iteration, a combination of techincal stability, 
tool sets, community awareness and clearly-defined steps to contribute, provided the basis
for substantial growth. The OSGeo-Live is now very stable, easily incorporates advances in 
components, and widely adopted.

More than fifty (50) open-source projects now actively maintain and improve their own
install scripts, examples and documentation.

Let's look at each of the building blocks briefly:

Technical Stability: An original goal of the OSGeo-Live was to operate well on
minimal hardware with broad support for common peripherals, and a license
structure compatible with project goals. The XUbuntu version of Ubuntu Linux
was chosen as a foundation, and it was been very successful. To this day,
almost all applications operate easily in very modest RAM and disk space
(with the notable exception of Java-based software which requires substantially
more RAM).

The OSGeo-Live itself is not a "linux distribution" per se, primarily because
the project does not provide a seamless upgrade process from one version to
another. The OSGeo-Live relies on the Ubuntu/Debian/GNU, apt-based ecosystem to
handle the heavy-lifting of system updates and upgrades. This is a win-win, as
updates are proven reliable over a very large Ubuntu community process, and
the OSGeo-Live project is freed to concentrate on adding value to its featured
components.

As we shall see, due to a component architecture, individual software projects
can be installed as-needed on a generic base.

Tool Sets: It cannot be overstated that, a key component to the success of the 
overall project has been the availability of widely-known and reliable tools, 
to developers from all parts of the world and in all major spoken languages. 
It is also important to note that rather than require formal installation packages 
".deb" for each project, the OSGeo-Live chose to use a simple install script format, one per
installed project. This choice proved crucial in the earliest stages, as an outside
open-source project evaluating participation in the Live could get started with
fewer barriers to entry, and then add rigor and features later. Almost by
definition, the candidate open-source projects had install scripts already
built for Linux which could be readily adopted to the OSGeo-Live install
conventions. By providing ample examples on the OSGeo-Live of install scripts
in major deployment contexts, for both applications and server processes,  and
clear guidelines for installation conventions, a new open-source project could
almost immediately develop and iterate their own install scripts in a
straightforward way.

Community Awareness: The processes of  adoption of new
technology - initial awareness, trialability, adoption and iteration -
are well-known [4]. 

In the case of the OSGeo-Live, an orginial design goal was to provide tools
to those doing geospatial fieldwork with limited resources, and who often lack
advanced programming and administration skills. 

Several years into the project, funding was established via a grant from the Australian 
government to build application documentation in a common one-page format,
meeting professional graphic design criteria. One, single page for each and every application, 
(Overview) and a second page with step-by-step introductory instructions (Quickstart), aimed at 
a capable reader but assuming no previous exposure to the software. Each one of these two pages 
is then translated into various spoken languages, primarily by volunteers. 

Much later, a graph of "percentage complete" for each human language group was added, 
which essentially makes translation into a sort of a competition. This has proved successful. 
Note that the initial effort to build standardized documentation required paid professionals. 
It seems unlikely that the documentation would have been successful based only on ad-hoc 
volunteer efforts.

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) the hub for a variety of projects to interoperate, and
potentially share with each other / synergy. OSGeo raises awareness of other projects.

Steps to Contribute

A FAQ was written and published in an easily accessible location. Outreach was
conducted through formal and informal networks.


Major step in diffusion is folks knowing what the thing is at all. Value add /
branding - OSGeo has credibility from foundation status, participants,
consistent / good graphic design.

misc cut text --

Eight
years ago, there existed several very large and growing open-source geospatial
projects, whose founders and developers decided would benefit from a common
legal and technical infrastructure. Those projects included GRASS, Mapserver,
GDAL and QGis.  At the same time. the OSGeo-Live began with a smaller open
project based in Australia that sought to build an "easy to try and use"
software environment for these and other spatial data applications. After some
discussion and planning conducted between a handful of intrepid principals
across the globe on the Internet, the nascent OSGeo-Live project committed
itself to the larger OSGeo Foundation structure in its second year. 

missing title ------------- What are the steps that established credibility to
get projects contributing to the distribution. Initially, just shell scripts to
install five core / important packages (XXX - what were they and why?). Reached
out to 50 projects, more outside of U.S. than in, including many non-english
(as a primary language), esp. from Europe. The social component of building the
community was not necessarily explicit or even shared or known to all
contributors (provable?).

It consists of a choice of basic tools that are widely known to free software
developers: shell, Perl, or Python. Scripts may call package managers, few
constraints (e.g., keep recipes contained to a particular directory). Core,
customizable scripts designed to bootstrap new recipes.

The result is that certain tools are becoming more and more visible. Projects
are encouraged that are implemented in standard frameworks (i.e., not Forth).

There's still not complete consensus, but the project is moving towards some
consensus infrastructure. Also

Other virtual machines ----------------------

From [Mining the Social Web, a Chef+Vagrant
solution](https://rawgit.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/
master/ipynb/html/_Appendix%20A%20-%20Virtual%20Machine%20Experience.html)

From Matt Gee (of [DSSG](http://dssg.io): We've been trying a number of
different approaches to the standard development environment. For this year's
fellowship we went with a Chef cookbook + OpsWorks. This works for provisioning
our core resources. However, for weekend learn-a-thons and more portable VM.
We've tried our own VM using docker and well as some hosted boxes like yhat's
new Science Box. We should compare notes.

VM from Philip.

BCE: The Berkeley Common Environment ------------------------------------

The goal for the BCE is to provide both the ready-made environments, and also
the "recipes" or scripts setting up these environments. It should be easy for a
competent linux user to create recipes for custom tools that might not be
braodly useful (and thus, not already in BCE).

For classwork and research in the sciences at Berkeley, broadly defined to
include social science, life science, physical science, and engineering. Using
these tools, users can start up a virtual machine (VM) with a standardized
Linux operating environment containing a set of standard software for
scientific computing. The user can start the VM on their laptop, on a
university server, or in the cloud. Furthermore, users will be able to modify
the instructions for producing or modifying the virtual machine in a
reproducible way for communication with and distribution to others.

We envision the following core use cases:

- creating a common computing environment for a course or workshop, - creating
a common computational environment to be shared by a group of researchers or
students, and - disseminating the computational environment so outsiders can
reproduce the results of a group.

Other use cases/benefits:

- Thin client / staff computing - Exam environments - Instructional labs -
Sharing licensed software? - Make it easy to do the "right" thing (hard to do
"wrong" thing) - Stable infrastructure - Managing complexity - Impacts beyond
"the course"

What problems does BCE solve for you?

- No more obscure installation issues - download and run a single virtual
machine or get the same environment on a bare metal or virtual server. - I'm
teaching a class - when you tell a student that a program behaves a certain
way, it does! - I'm collaborating on some scientific research - now all of your
collaborators can run your code without complex installation instructions. -
Easy Deployment - Replication / Reproducible research - Easy transition across
scales (laptop to cluster) - Tricky installs

To accomplish this, we envision that BCE will encompass the following:

- a reproducible workflow that creates the standard VM/image with standard
scientific computing software such as Python, R, git, etc., - a standard binary
image, produced by the workflow, that can be distributed as is and used
on-the-fly with VirtualBox or VMWare Player with minimal dependencies, and -
(possibly) an augmented workflow that represents multiple possible
distributions tailored for different types of uses (e.g., different
disciplines, different computational needs, class vs. research use, etc.). This
might represent either a sequence or a tree of possible VMs.


*Tentative list of features*

- VMs

- A fixed, versioned VM provided each semester as a binary image for classes
and workshops - Ideally, the same VM usable for research, with functionality
for parallel computing and provisioned such that it can be used as the VM for
virtual cluster nodes - The VM runnable on user laptops (Mac/Windows/Linux) and
on cloud machines - The VM usable on user machines with minimal dependencies
(e.g., either VirtualBox or VMware) and minimal setup, and with clear
instructions for users on setup and on getting data/files into and out of the
VM - Agreement on minimal hardware requirements on the host machine - do we
support 32 bit, any minimum RAM required? - Shared folders (EBS on AWS), or
other tech to make it possible to separate data from VM.

- Provisioning

- Provisioning is fully scripted - if the appropriate software is installed,
the recipe should run reliably. - The provisioning details used to create a
given VM available to users and with clear instructions on how to use and
modify the provisioning; ideally the provisioning would be relatively simple
for users to understand - The ability for a user to add software to a VM and
then 'export' that information back into the provisioning workflow that can be
used to recreate the modified VM

- Logistics and training

- A GitHub repository or the like plus a project website with all BCE materials
available - Communication with users on bugs, desired features, and the like
via the repository and a mailing list - Management / Versioning / Snapshotting

- Problems

- VMs reserve compute resources exclusively (less of a problem with LXC-like
solutions). - Testing / Issue tracking

*Students ("horizontal" collaboration), Researchers ("vertical" collaboration)*

If you'd like to use the VM as a student, researcher, or instructor, our goal
is to make this easy for you.

If you're using VirtualBox, [follow these instructions](using-virtualbox.html).

If you'd like to use the VM on Amazon's EC2 cloud platform, [follow these
instructions](using-ec2.html).

Adding modules?

*Creating (and modifying) the BCE VM*

All the files for creating the VM are in the collaboratool repository on
GitHub.

To clone the repository from the command line:

git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool

Then go to the provisioning directory and see the information in HOWTO.md.

*VirtualBox*

* Download and install VirtualBox from the [VirtualBox
website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). This is the tool the runs
the virtual machine for you. * Download the BCE VM in the form of an OVA file
from [UNDER CONSTRUCTION](BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova). * Open VirtualBox and
import the BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova file you just downloaded by going to
"File->Import Appliance" and then selecting the .ova file from wherever you
downloaded it to (possible 'Downloads' in your home directory on the machine).
* Wait a few minutes... * Start the virtual machine by clicking on the tab for
"BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64" on the left side and then clicking "Start" at the
top. This will start a virtual Linux computer within your own machine. After a
few seconds you should see black screen and then soon you'll see the desktop of
the VM.

You now have a machine that has all the software installed as part of BCE,
including IPython and useful Python packages and R, RStudio and useful R
packages.

You can get a terminal window that allows you to type commands in a UNIX-style
shell by clicking on the icon of the black box with the $ symbo on the top
panel. Using this you can start IPython Notebook by simply typing "ipython
notebook" or  R by simply typing 'R' at the prompt in the terminal. This starts
a bare-bones R session. To start RStudio, either type 'rstudio' at the prompt
on go to "Applications->Programming->RStudio".

You can restart the VM at any time by opening VirtualBox and clicking on the
tab for the VM and clicking "Start" as you did above.

*Sharing folders and copying files between your computer and the VM*

One useful thing will be to share folders between the VM and the host machine
so that you can access the files on your computer from the VM. Do the
following:

* Got to "Devices->Shared Folder Settings" and click on the icon of a folder
with a "+" on the right side. * Select a folder to share, e.g. your home
directory on your computer by clicking on "Folder Path" and choosing "Other"
and navigating to the folder of interest. For our purposes here, assume we
click on "Documents". * Click "make permanent" and "auto-mount" and then click
"Ok". * Reboot the machine by going to applications button on the left of the
top toolbart, clicking on "Log Out", and choosing "Restart" in the window that
pops up. * Once the VM is running again, click on the "Shared" folder on the
desktop. You should see the folder "sf_Documents" (or whatever the folder name
you selected was, in place of 'Documents'). You can drag and drop files to
manipulate them. * Alternatively, from the Terminal, you can also see the
directory by doing "cd ~/Desktop/shared/sf_Documents" and then "ls" will show
you the files.

Be careful: unless you selected "read only" at the same time as "make
permanent", any changes to the shared folder on the VM affects the folder in
the 'real world', namely your computer.

*EC2*

- Go to [EC2 management console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and choose the
US-West-2 (Oregon) region, as that is where we have posted the BCE AMI. (You'll
need to have an account set up.) - On the "AMIs" tab, search for the BCE AMI
amongst public images. - Launch an instance 55. Follow the instructions given
in the "Connect" button to SSH to the instance - If you want to connect as the
"oski" user, you can deposit your public SSH key in the .ssh folder of the
"oski" user.


Examples for proper rst formatting ----------------------------------

Code highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

def sum(a, b): """Sum two numbers."""

return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c :linenos:

int main() { for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { /* do something */ } return 0; }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c :linenos: :linenostart: 2

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { /* do something */ }

Important Part --------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test some
maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an equation on a
separate line:

.. math::

g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math:: :type: eqnarray

g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\ &=& \ldots


The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math:: :label: circarea

A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math:: :label: spherevol

V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or (:ref:`spherevol`)
later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png :align: center :figclass: w

This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png :scale: 20% :figclass: bht

This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you
reference auto-numbered figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

+------------+----------------+ | Material   | Units          |
+------------+----------------+ | Stone      | 3              |
+------------+----------------+ | Water      | 12             |
+------------+----------------+ | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
+------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table :ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

\setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table. :class: w

+--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+ | This   | is |  a   |
very | very | wide | table  |
+--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+


Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse:

*Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.*
